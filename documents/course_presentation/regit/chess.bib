abstract={A central challenge of artificial intelligence is to create machines that can learn from their own experience and perform at the level of human experts. Using an evolutionary algorithm, a computer program has learned to play chess by playing games against itself. The program learned to evaluate chessboard configurations by using the positions of pieces, material and positional values, and neural networks to assess specific sections of the chessboard. During evolution, the program improved its play by almost 400 rating points. Testing under simulated tournament conditions against Pocket Fritz 2.0 indicated that the evolved program performs above the master level.},

@ARTICLE{Wirth:2015:on-learning,
author={Wirth, C. and Furnkranz, J.},
journal={Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on},
title={On Learning From Game Annotations},
year={2015},
volume={7},
number={3},
pages={304-316},
abstract={Most of the research in the area of evaluation function
                  learning is focused on self-play. However in many
                  domains, like Chess, expert feedback is amply
                  available in the form of annotated games. This
                  feedback usually comes in the form of qualitative
                  information because human annotators find it hard to
                  determine precise utility values for game
                  states. The goal of this work is to investigate
                  inasmuch it is possible to leverage this qualitative
                  feedback for learning an evaluation function for the
                  game. To this end, we show how the game annotations
                  can be translated into preference statements over
                  moves and game states, which in turn can be used for
                  learning a utility function that respects these
                  preference constraints. We evaluate the resulting
                  function by creating multiple heuristics based upon
                  different sized subsets of the training data and
                  compare them in a tournament scenario. The results
                  showed that learning from game annotations is
                  possible, but, on the other hand, our learned
                  functions did not quite reach the performance of the
                  original, manually tuned function of the Chess
                  program. The reason for this failure seems to lie in
                  the fact that human annotators only annotate
                  <<interesting>> positions, so that it is hard to
                  learn basic information, such as material advantage
                  from game annotations alone.},
